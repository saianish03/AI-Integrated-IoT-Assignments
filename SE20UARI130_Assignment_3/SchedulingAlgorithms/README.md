### Question 1:
OUTPUT:
 <br> 
        **FCFS:** <br> 
        - Average waiting time: 16         <br> 
        - Average Turnaround time: 27      <br> 
        **SJF:** <br> 
        - Average waiting time: 16.0000    <br> 
        - Average Turnaround time: 27.0000 <br> 
        **PS:** <br> 
        - Average waiting time: 12.0000    <br> 
        - Average Turnaround time: 23.0000 <br> 
        **RR:** <br> 
        - Average waiting time: 10.0000    <br> 
        - Average Turnaround time: 20.0000 <br> 
        Based on the above average times, **RR(Round Robin) is MOST SUITABLE** <br> 
 <br> 
Based on the given average results, **Round Robin(RR)** is the Most suitable algorithm for this question.

      - Average Turnaround time: 57 <br> 
      **SJF:** <br> 
      - Average waiting time: 23.0000 <br> 
      - Average Turnaround time: 50.0000 <br> 
      **PS:** <br> 
      - Average waiting time: 41.0000 <br> 
      - Average Turnaround time: 67.0000 <br> 
      Based on the above average times, **SJF is the MOST SUITABLE** <br> 
 <br> 
Based on the given average results, **Shortest Job First(SJF)** is the Most suitable algorithm for this question.
