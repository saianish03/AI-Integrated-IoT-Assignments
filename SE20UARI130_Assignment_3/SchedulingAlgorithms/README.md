## Analysis of the algorithms in Q1 and Q2:

### Question 1:
OUTPUT:
        FCFS:
        Average waiting time: 16        
        Average Turnaround time: 27     
        SJF:
        Average waiting time: 16.0000   
        Average Turnaround time: 27.0000
        PS:
        Average waiting time: 12.0000   
        Average Turnaround time: 23.0000
        RR:
        Average waiting time: 10.0000   
        Average Turnaround time: 20.0000
        Based on the above average times, RR(Round Robin) is MOST SUITABLE

Based on the given average results, Round Robin is the Most suitable algorithm for this question


### Question 2: 
OUTPUT:
      FCFS:
      Average waiting time: 31
      Average Turnaround time: 57
      SJF:
      Average waiting time: 23.0000
      Average Turnaround time: 50.0000
      PS:
      Average waiting time: 41.0000
      Average Turnaround time: 67.0000
      Based on the above average times, SJF is the MOST SUITABLE

Based on the given average results, Round Robin is the Most suitable algorithm for this question
